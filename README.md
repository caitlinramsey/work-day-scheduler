# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

The challenge this week was to create a work day scheduler calendar. When the calendar is opened, the current date should display at the top. The calendar was supposed to have timeblocks with standard business hours. The timeblocks were supposed to be color coded to indicate past (gray), present (red), or future (green). The user should be able to save an event for each hour of the day which will then be saved in local storage.

Below is a screenshot of my application:
